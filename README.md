creates a directory & a mirror anaconda environment. Tkinter notepad takes user input, saves it to source directory, ./corrupt.sh corrupts the text file, and it gets thrown into the anaconda environment - essentially moving it into the ether!

ideally this will be built out into an actual front-end application, but at the moment uses tkinter & anaconda as a placeholder.
